C++ implementation of regraining algorithm for correcting grainy areas in color-matched images as described in:

[F. Pitie , A. Kokaram and R. Dahyot "Automated colour grading using colour distribution transfer" *(2007) Computer Vision and Image Understanding*](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.7694&rep=rep1&type=pdf)


Inspired by the [author's MATLAB implementation](https://github.com/frcs/colour-transfer).
